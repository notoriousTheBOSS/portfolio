                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                I'm a passionate, software engineer who
                                specializes in full stack development (Vue.js &
                                Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing
                                the technical and visual aspects of digital
                                products to life. User experience, pixel perfect
                                design, and writing clear, readable, highly
                                performant code matters to me.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I began my journey as a web developer in 2015,
                                and since then, I've continued to grow and
                                evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges
                                and learning the latest technologies along the
                                way. Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after
                                starting my web development journey, I'm
                                building cutting-edge web applications using
                                modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript,
                                Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy
                                working on products end to end, from ideation
                                all the way to development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can
                                find me hovering around on twitter or on indie
                                hacker, witnessing the journey of early startups
                                or enjoying some free time. You can follow me on
                                Linked where I share tech-related bites and
                                build in public, or you can follow me on GitHub.
